Hi, I'm [Chandler Lutz](https://chandlerlutz.github.io/), a financial economist at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA). I am also a research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate. My research employs machine learning, econometric, and statistical methods in the study of housing markets, labor economics, and monetary policy.

 In recent work, I have developed [new datasets](https://github.com/ChandlerLutz/LandUnavailabilityData) that measure the amount of [land unavailable for housing construction](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3478900) across the United States and causally assessed the impact of [interest rate declines on distressed borrowers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3869199). My research has been published in the [*Review of Financial Studies*](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/34/2/864/5842150), the [*Journal of Labor Economics*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/703579), and the [*Journal of Urban Economics*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119016300419), among other outlets. My policy work at the SEC spans housing markets as well as financial risk and macroeconomic analysis.
